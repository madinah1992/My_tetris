# Welcome to My Tetris
***

## Task
Create a Tetris game using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript that runs in a web browser. 
The challenge is to implement the core functionalities of Tetris, such as piece generation, rotation, movement, collision detection, line clearing, and scoring.


## Description
I solved the problem by using HTML5 Canvas for rendering the game board and JavaScript to handle the game logic, 
including piece generation, movement, collision detection, line clearing, and scoring. 
The game is controlled using keyboard inputs for intuitive gameplay.


## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tetris-game.git
    cd tetris-game
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, download and install it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Start the server:**
    ```sh
    node html_server.js
    ```

## Usage
1. **Open the game:**
    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to play the game.

2. **Game Controls:**
    - **Left Arrow Key:** Move piece left
    - **Right Arrow Key:** Move piece right
    - **Down Arrow Key:** Soft drop piece
    - **Up Arrow Key:** Rotate piece
    - **Space Bar:** Hard drop piece
```
